# Simplified Implementation Plan for Canova Database Refactoring

## Phase 1: Consolidate into DatabaseManager (2-3 days)

1. **Update DatabaseManager**
   - Add all necessary methods from services directly into DatabaseManager
   - Implement AsyncStorage operations directly (remove AsyncStorageManager)
   - Remove delegation chains and simplify access patterns
   - Ensure all methods are well-documented

2. **Create Migration Script**
   - Develop a script to help migrate component imports
   - Test the script on a few sample components

## Phase 2: Component Migration (1 week)

1. **Prioritize components**
   - Identify high-traffic/critical components to migrate first
   - Create a component dependency map to guide the migration

2. **Migrate components in stages**
   - Update imports from services to DatabaseManager
   - Replace service method calls with direct DatabaseManager calls
   - Test each component after migration

3. **Update hooks**
   - Replace service-specific hooks with direct DatabaseManager hooks
   - Simplify context providers that use database services

## Phase 3: Remove Deprecated Code (1-2 days)

1. **Verify all components are migrated**
   - Run codebase analysis to ensure no service imports remain
   - Check for any runtime issues with the new approach

2. **Remove deprecated files**
   - Delete service files (DataService, StrainService, etc.)
   - Delete unnecessary manager files (AsyncStorageManager, ExpoSQLiteManager)
   - Remove any remaining utility files related to the old architecture

3. **Cleanup remaining references**
   - Check for any stray references to removed services
   - Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation (2-3 days)

1. **Run comprehensive tests**
   - Unit tests for DatabaseManager methods
   - Integration tests for database operations
   - UI tests for components using DatabaseManager

2. **Validate migration success**
   - Use DbValidator to verify database integrity
   - Compare app performance before and after migration
   - Ensure no regressions in functionality

3. **Final code review**
   - Conduct a full code review of the new architecture
   - Address any remaining issues or edge cases

## Expected Benefits

- **Reduced complexity**: ~50% reduction in database-related code
- **Improved maintainability**: Clearer data flow and fewer abstractions
- **Better performance**: Fewer layers of indirection
- **Easier debugging**: Direct tracing of database operations
- **Simplified onboarding**: New developers can understand the architecture faster

## Potential Risks

- **Breaking changes**: Components relying on deprecated services may break
- **Migration bugs**: Overlooked edge cases during migration
- **Transition period**: Temporary instability during the migration

## Mitigation Strategies

- **Extensive testing**: Comprehensive test suite to catch issues early
- **Phased approach**: Gradual migration rather than a big bang change
- **Rollback plan**: Ability to revert to the previous architecture if critical issues arise

This plan provides a clear roadmap for simplifying the database architecture while maintaining app functionality and stability.
