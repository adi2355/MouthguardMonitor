# Implementation Plan for Canova Database Refactoring

## Overview

This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for consolidating multiple database services into a single DatabaseManager. The goal is to simplify the architecture, reduce code complexity, and improve maintainability.

## Timeline

| Phase | Description | Duration | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Phase 1 | Consolidate into DatabaseManager | 2-3 days | Completed |
| Phase 2 | Component Migration | 1 week | Not Started |
| Phase 3 | Remove Deprecated Code | 1-2 days | Not Started |
| Phase 4 | Testing and Validation | 2-3 days | Not Started |
| **Total** | | **~2 weeks** | **In Progress** |

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Consolidate into DatabaseManager (Completed)

- [x] Update DatabaseManager with methods from services
  - [x] Add AsyncStorage operations from AsyncStorageManager
  - [x] Add strain-related methods from StrainService
  - [x] Add data operations from DataService
  - [x] Ensure consistent error handling and logging

- [x] Create migration tools
  - [x] Component dependency map generator
  - [x] Automated migration script
  - [x] Hooks migration analyzer
  - [x] Migration verification script

- [x] Create documentation
  - [x] Migration guide
  - [x] Example migrations
  - [x] Troubleshooting tips

### Phase 2: Component Migration (Not Started)

- [ ] Identify high-priority components
  - [ ] Use the dependency map to prioritize
  - [ ] Focus on simpler components first

- [ ] Migrate components in stages
  - [ ] Run automated migration script
  - [ ] Manually test and fix remaining issues
  - [ ] Create comprehensive tests for migrated components

- [ ] Update hooks
  - [ ] Use hooks migration analyzer
  - [ ] Migrate service-specific hooks to DatabaseManager hooks
  - [ ] Test hooks thoroughly

### Phase 3: Remove Deprecated Code (Not Started)

- [ ] Verify all components are migrated
  - [ ] Run verification script
  - [ ] Check for any remaining service imports
  - [ ] Ensure all functionality is preserved

- [ ] Remove deprecated files
  - [ ] DataService
  - [ ] StrainService
  - [ ] AsyncStorageManager
  - [ ] ExpoSQLiteManager
  - [ ] Any related utility files

- [ ] Cleanup remaining references
  - [ ] Check for any stray references
  - [ ] Update import paths if needed
  - [ ] Remove unused types or constants

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (Not Started)

- [ ] Run comprehensive tests
  - [ ] Unit tests for DatabaseManager methods
  - [ ] Integration tests for database operations
  - [ ] UI tests for components

- [ ] Validate migration success
  - [ ] Compare app performance before and after
  - [ ] Ensure no regressions in functionality
  - [ ] Verify data integrity

- [ ] Final code review
  - [ ] Full review of the new architecture
  - [ ] Address any remaining issues or edge cases
  - [ ] Document lessons learned

## Migration Evaluation Metrics

- **Code reduction**: Target ~50% reduction in database-related code
- **Performance**: Measure any performance improvements from simplified architecture
- **Maintainability**: Evaluate clarity of data flow
- **Developer experience**: Gather feedback on improved architecture

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Breaking changes | Extensive testing after each component migration |
| Migration bugs | Phased approach with verification at each step |
| Performance issues | Compare performance metrics before and after |
| Data integrity | Validate database operations in multiple environments |

## Next Steps After Completion

1. Update architecture documentation to reflect the new simplified approach
2. Share lessons learned with the wider team
3. Apply similar refactoring patterns to other areas of the codebase if beneficial
